Installation
============

The first step you need to do is to install the extension – kk_downloader – with the extension manager.
You can get it by going to Tools section and choosing **Extension Manager** on the
main action menu (usually on left-side). Then in the dropdown Menu at the top, select **Import Extensions** in the
Menu at top. Then type "kk_downloader" in the **Extensions in TYPO3 Extension Repository** and click on
the **Look up** button. You should then find this extension.

If you have never installed this, then you will see a red arrow to the left of **kk_downloader** and you
can click on that to install. If it has been installed, you can click on the green arrow to the left of the
extension or the name of the extension and then load the newest version by clicking on the Import/Update button.
It is highly recommended to install the newest extension in the “local” folder (LOCAL: typo3conf/ext/kk_downloader).
